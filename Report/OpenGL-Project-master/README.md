# OpenGL-Project
This repository contains a simple computer graphics project showing the animation of robot being transformed to a vehicle. The animation was created using OpenGL and C++. Everything was done using CodeBlocks (open source compiler). Anyone who knows the basics of OpenGL can easily understand the code used for this project.<br/><br/>
The project was submitted to New Horizon College of Engineering in May 2016 as a computer graphics mini project. All the things learned during sixth semester has been put up in this project. I have tried to use very less number of functions. The code is little longer than it should be cause I have focussed more on making the code understandable. Anybody looking to do computer graphics project can use this project as a reference and go for better projects.<br/><br/>
